# Python Programming Assignments

![](machinelearning.jpg)

This repositry contains the python versions of the programming assignments for the [Machine Learning online class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) taught by Professor Andrew Ng. This is perhaps the most popular introductory online machine learning class. In addition to being popular, it is also one of the best Machine learning classes any interested student can take to get started with machine learning. An unfortunate aspect of this class is that the programming assignments are in MATLAB or OCTAVE, probably because this class was made before python became the go-to language in machine learning.

This repository contains solved python assignments.The unsolved assignments used for this can be found at [`dibgerge`'s](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments) python implementation of the assignments.

It is highly recommended to use the unsolved version for the purpose of completion of the course. This repository is only for help if stuck on a problem for a long time and one should not use exact codes from here as that would reap no benefit to the learner.
